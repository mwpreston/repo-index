# Rubrik API Integrations for Every Use Case
Integrating Rubrik into your enterprise tools and workflows has never been easier. 

## Project Types

Rubrik has three different types of projects centering around API consumption:

* **SDKs** - SDKs allow the creation of applications in a specific programming language
* **Tooling Integrations** - Tooling Integrations seamlessly integrate with Rubrik to make testing, development or monitoring tasks easier and more efficient
* **Use Cases** - Use Cases are automated workflows that can be leveraged in your envionment to achieve a very specific goal

## Support
Depending on the SDK, Integration, or Use Case one of the following support models are applied:

* **Rubrik Supported** - a project that is owned and maintained by Rubrik while accepting contributions from the community
* **Community Supported** - a project that is owned and maintained by the Build community
* **Partner Supported** - a project that is owned and maintained by a Partner and Rubrik while accepting contributions from the community

The `README.md` of each repository should designate the project type.

## Contributing

A first step to contributing is to pick an existing project or to submit an idea for a new project.

Projects will often have issues, which can be either a bug fix or enhancement request, that are labeled as [`first-timer`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arubrikinc+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timer&unscoped_q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timer) or [`exp-beginner`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Arubrikinc+is%3Aopen+label%3Aexp-beginner) that can help new contributors get involved.

The [Contributor Guide](contributors/guide/README.md) provides detailed instruction on how to get your ideas and bug fixes seen and accepted, including:

1. How to [file an issue](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-handling.md)
1. How to [find something to work on](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/contributors/guide/labels.md)
1. How to [open a pull request](https://github.com/rubrikinc/welcome-to-rubrik-build/blob/master/contributors/guide/submitting-pull-requests.md)
